* Fuseki db in RDF format already structured in a way for relationships
  * i.e. queries can be used to gather all transitive properties in a graph node-connecting relationship
* have a canned set of queries and match up the english language nouns/verbs to these queries
* once query is created, issue the command -> fill in the blanks and present output to user
* use case: board meeting at jpl and someone wants to know mass of a spacecraft from the Fuseki db
  * Alexa could be the overarching application which interfaces with our chatpot and provides the answer back in English
* utilize existing chat bot frameworks & nlp libraries
