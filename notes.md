# Notes

* have a canned set of queries and match up the english language nouns/verbs to these queries
* once query is created, issue the command -> fill in the blanks and present output to user
* use case: board meeting at jpl and someone wants to know mass of a spacecraft from the Fuseki db
  * Alexa could be the overarching db which provides the answer back
* utilize existing chat bot frameworks & nlp libraries
